So as I have worked on automation and for automation I have used Cypress as framework, so I have written the code in Cypress.

So we will repeat these steps 20 times and we can’t use for loop in cypress 
because of the async nature of cypress and similarly
if we talk about printing a table it is also not possible to print table in cypress. 
These formation of tables will be done manually when cypress is used. 
But I know this can be achieved in Selenium but as of now I haven’t learned selenium and if I get chance to learn selenium then I will definitely learn selenium.
